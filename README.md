Thinkst HackWeek 2022 repo

For Thinkst's 2022 Hackweek, I built a web service that uses Deezer's API to play music selected based on your HR (via ANT+ sensor over a USB dongle) and target HR. 
If your sliding window of HR is below your target it'll select higher tempo music from a more energetic genre and vice versa if you're above your target.
